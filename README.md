# QR Code Generator using Node.js

The **QR Code Generator** is a Node.js project that allows users to generate QR codes from input strings, passwords, or website URLs. This project is built with Node.js, Express.js for the server, Joi for input validation, prompt-sync for user interaction, and various middlewares to enhance functionality. The generated QR codes can be scanned to reveal the input string or access the specified website.


## Features
